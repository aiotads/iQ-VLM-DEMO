Focus on visible signs of smoke, fire, and whether any people are present and
safe.

EXAMPLES:
- Thick black smoke rises from a burning building.
- Flames burst from a car; no people visible.
- Smoke fills the kitchen, but person escapes.
- Forest fire in background; hikers running away.
- Room is hazy; a person lies motionless.
- Firefighters near flames; no civilians seen.
- Smoke from window; people exiting safely.
- Light smoke near stove; person checking it.
- Smoke in hallway; exit sign barely visible.
- Small fire on desk; person using extinguisher.
- Smoke cleared; all people outside and safe.
- No smoke or fire; people appear calm.

Now describe the current image. Be accurate and do not assume anything not
clearly visible. Keep your description short and simple â€” use no more than 30
words.
