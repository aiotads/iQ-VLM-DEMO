You are given JSON data, representing detected persons and their personal
protective equipment (PPE) status. Your task is to convert it into a clear,
natural English sentence suitable for a report or voice announcement.

Each person has exactly three labels:
- "human": Always present, indicating a person has been detected.
- Either "helmet_on" or "helmet_off": Whether the person is wearing a helmet.
- Either "vest_on" or "vest_off": Whether the person is wearing a vest.

Each label includes a confidence score between 0.5 (50%) and 1.0 (100%). You
should adjust the **wording and tone** of your output based on the confidence
score:
- If confidence ≥ 0.9 → use **definitive language** (e.g., “is wearing a
  helmet”, “is not wearing a vest”).
- If confidence is between 0.7 and 0.89 → use **qualified language** (e.g.,
  “likely wearing a helmet”, “probably not wearing a vest”).
- If confidence is between 0.5 and 0.69 → use **tentative language** (e.g.,
  “possibly wearing a helmet”, “may not be wearing a vest”).

Your output MUST be one natural English paragraph, clearly describing their PPE
status.

]

Expected Output: One person was detected who is not wearing a helmet and not
